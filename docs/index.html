Software Design</h1>
<p >The software ran on the nucleo is designed using a number of generators which operate as tasks scheduled in <a class="el" href="main_8py.html" title="Runs main logic of the image plotter and loops through tasks.">main.py</a>. These tasks are the motor task, user task, logic task, and solenoid task. The code ran in <a class="el" href="main_8py.html" title="Runs main logic of the image plotter and loops through tasks.">main.py</a> is meant to accept a singular rectangular coordinate from the user and convert them into motor angles. Then the motors will send the solenoid to that location. By using serial port communication, we can continue to send new rectangular coordinates until we have fully drawn a picture. Besides accepting rectangular coordinates,our code will also accept up "{" and down "}" commands to control the solenoid. First we have all our task diagram and how they interact and share varables.<br  />

<div class="caption">
Figure 1: Image Plotter Task Diagram</div></div>
<p> <br  />
 The task diagram shows our 3 different tasks and how they communicate. The User task sends the x and y coordinates of the next point to the motor task. The Motor task sends whether the robot is finished moving to the User task The User task sends whether to drop or lift the marker to the Solenoid task. Next sections show each States State Transition Diagram. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="User"></a>
User Task</h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="FSMUser.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Figure 2: UserTask State Transition Diagram</div></div>
<p> <br  />
 This is the User Task which describes the task the microcontroller runs to take input from the computer through the serial bus.</p>
<p >Input is sent line by line in the form of points (rectangular coordinates) and brackets indicating control of the solenoid ([ means drop the marker, ] means lift the marker). This can be seen in the text files in the TestImages folder on github. The series of points and brackets to control the robot is generated in sobel.py. The files are sent in PC.py, which is run by the computer during runtime of the system.</p>
<p >On the microcontroller side, this task waits for input and interperets it (using the built in python function eval to convert strings to float tuples)to be used by other tasks. When the robot is ready for another input (when it finished the current function i.e move to a point or drop/raise solenoid) it replies "READY" to the computer. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Motor"></a>
Motors Task</h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="FSMMotors.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Figure 3: Motor State Transition Diagram</div></div>
<p> <br  />
 This is the Motor task. The motors are first initialized, which involves creating two motor driver, two encoder, and two closed loop controller objects. The rectangular coordinates are converted to polar and sent to the motor drivers. Once the encoder reads that the motors have reached the positions they're supposed to be at, the task outputs that the move is finished so the User Task can read the next point. We also have a switch that allows us to calibrate the motor so it knows its current position. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Solenoid"></a>
Solenoid Task</h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="FSMSolenoid.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Figure 4: Solenoid State Transition Diagram</div></div>
<p> <br  />
 This is the Solenoid task which moves the marker up and down using the solenoid. This simple task takes input from the User task as a boolean for turning on and off the solenoid. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Classes"></a>
Classes</h2>
<p >This section has in depth descriptions of each class.</p>
<p ><a class="el" href="motor__driver_8py.html" title="Creates and sends motors as dutys.">motor_driver.py</a> contains the Motor_driver class which uses an input duty cycle and Timer to control a motor at the given pins. The duty cycle values are bounded from -100 to 100 percent, negative numbers being an opposite spin direction to positive numbers. <br  />
</p>
<p ><a class="el" href="_encoder_8py.html" title="Creates and recieves encoder data from the moter.">Encoder.py</a> contains the Encoder class which reads the motor encoder at the given pin at a given interval using a timer. The position is output in radians from the function Encoder.read().</p>
<p ><a class="el" href="closedloop_8py.html" title="Closed loop controller containing methods to control an arbitraries motor duty cycle.">closedLoop.py</a> contains the ClosedLoop class which sets up a PID controller using the given Kp (proportional gain). This controller finds the error between the current and reference value of the motor to update the duty at which the motor will be run for correction.</p>
<p >sobel.py uses the openCV library to convert an image to a series of points, sorted by contours (adjacency for the robot to draw continously). This is done using a sobel filter to find the image gradient and then thresholding those values and finding the contours of the image to draw a rough sketch of it.</p>
<p >Pc.py reads a text file (generated by sobel.py) and outputs (through the serial bus) one line every time the string READY is recieved from the serial bus.</p>
<p ><a class="el" href="task__share_8py.html" title="This file contains classes which allow tasks to share data without the risk of data corruption by int...">task_share.py</a> contains Share and Queue classes which allow tasks to share data.</p>
<p ><a class="el" href="cotask_8py.html" title="This file contains classes to run cooperatively scheduled tasks in a multitasking system.">cotask.py</a> contains the classes Task and Tasklist which allow classes to run cooperatively. </p>
